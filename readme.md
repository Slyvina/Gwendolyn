# Gwendolyn

Gwendolyn is just a simple clock program with an alarm scheduler and a nice countdown.
It's simple, but it does its job. It was for me a kind of practise project and I had fun coding it.

Aside from a normal clock Gwendolyn can also show you the clock used by the inhabitants of my world Phantasar, about which I write novels.

# Name

The application is named after Gwendolyn Chrono, an Elf of the Drop-Out Tribe in my Phantasar Chronicles, who has the supernatural ability to always tell the time right without the need to use a clock or any other kind of device. She can just sense it.
In her tribe it's customary that you EARN your last name based on your accomplishment or special abilities, and I guess her last name is clearly based on this ability.

# License

The application itself is released under the GPL3 license. The mascot pictures are all part of the Phantasar Chronicles and as such not provided in this repository. Gwendolyn will be able to run without them, but just not show anything. You can put in your own mascot pictures if you like.
Since the alarm sounds are not mine, I could also not include them, and it's therefore recommended to add some of your own.

# Compiling

Compiling instructions will be provided in a separate document. For Windows you will need Visual Studio, for Linux you will need SCons and GCC.
On both platforms you will also need [Jalondi](https://github.com/jcr6/Jalondi) to be present and it's executable to be available in the PATH (on Windows PowerShell will be used to access it).
